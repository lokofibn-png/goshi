1. You have explicit written permission for all targets
2. You operate within legal bug bounty programs or internal audits
3. All DDoS/stress testing is confined to your own infrastructure
4. You log all actions in `logs/audit.log` for legal transparency
5. Any misuse violates CFAA, EU Cybercrime laws, and your conscience
